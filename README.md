# Final-Project
Due to time i have to turn this is in early and unfinished but for the most part it is finished
+ reserve pile finished and stacks correctly, only top card grabbable
+ waste pile has 3 cards and all are able to be grabbed/ they are changed from stock
+ all cards are able to be grabbed and moved with image however unable to be placed in specific spots
+ stock is blue as a show that there is cards face down there
+ tableau is filled and there is one card in foundation
+ start game button works and initiates game
+ game compiles and works despite issues 
+ code written for processes however unsure if it works due to unfinished code

Issues:
+ drag and drop works but due to something that im unsure of i am not able to drop it into place (i did not have time to fully figure this out) 
+ waste pile still needs to cycle back into the stock. 
+ unsure if score works due to unfinished game however it is there and should work.
